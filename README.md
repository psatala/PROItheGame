# PROItheGame
The aim of this project was to create a simple 2D platform game from scratch using the SDL2 library. 
You can read more about the mechanics of the game [here](https://github.com/psatala/PROItheGame/blob/master/PROItheGame/Documentation/Documentation.pdf).
To navigate the menu, please use your mouse and the ESC key. To check the controls, go to <b>OPTIONS->CONTROLS</b>.

Please keep in mind that this project was developed for <b>Windows</b> - compatibility with other operating systems is not yet provided (mostly due to the SDL2 library).
Should you have any questions about the implementation, please refer to the game's [documentation](https://github.com/psatala/PROItheGame/blob/master/PROItheGame/Documentation/Doxygen%20Documentation/Documentation-Doxygen.pdf).

This project was created during the second semester of computer science studies for the Objective Programming course.
That required it to be written in C++ language. 
Therefore, the focus of the project was not on game and level design, but on Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.
